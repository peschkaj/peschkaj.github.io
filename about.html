            I’m a PhD student at Portland State University, where I study
            functional programming and systems programming. I live in Portland,
            OR with my wife Kendra and two dogs – Stormy and Freyja. I like loud
            music, technology, solving problems, food, and sharing what I know.
            I’ve been blogging in one form or another since 2000.

            Although a lot of the early work has been lost to time, you can find
            my blog posts at:

            I started off my career as a UNIX system administrator taking care
            of big iron UNIX running HP-UX and Solaris. Throughout my career, I
            became impressed with the power of data and databases; I figured out
            that a few well-formed lines of code in a database can lead to
            greater performance than tuning application code. With this
            knowledge in hand, I embarked on a career path of mentoring my peers
            and providing technical leadership.

            I turned my enthusiasm for helping others learn into a passion for
            teaching, sharing, and presenting. In 2009, I was awarded the MVP
            award by Microsoft for my contributions to the SQL Server community.

            In early 2011, I started Brent Ozar Unlimited with Brent Ozar and
            Kendra Little. We had a vision about how consulting should work – we
            love sharing what we know and that is a primary goal of our
            training. It was a lot of fun, but in 2015 it was time to move on.

            I'm currently a graduate student at Portland State University. My
            studies have focused on systems programming and programming
            languages. I'm particularly interested in ways to apply aspects of
            functional programming to systems programming to develop safer
            systems languages and how to write code that's easier to understand.
